# Timed-Quiz
For this assignment, I initially set up the HtML framework, separating the pages and buttons that I wanted to be displayed with different id's. I then set the attributes to the html on css, setting the webpage, to how I wanted it to look. Afterwords, I began the coding for the javascript. I first made a file, and wrote a small pseudocode, which I have listed in my files. Afterwords, I began righting out my javascript, to begin at the starting page, and progress to the quiz questions, after the start button is clicked. A timer is also set once the start button is pressed, when the button is reduced to 0, a gamer over alert is called, and you are returned to the strarting screen. I added the questions, grouped together with their answers, and the correct answers, into an array. When the incorrect answer is selected, the timer is reduced by 10 seconds. For every correct answer, you gain 1 score. After the length in the questions array is reduced to 0, you will be brought to the end screen, where you will be shown your final score, and will be able to enter your initials. These will both be stored into the local storage.
